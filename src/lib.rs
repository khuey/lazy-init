#![deny(missing_docs)]

//! A crate for things that are
//! 1) Lazily initialized
//! 2) Expensive to create
//! 3) Immutable after creation
//! 4) Used on multiple threads
//!
//! `Lazy<T>` is better than `Mutex<Option<T>>` because after creation accessing
//! `T` does not require any locking, just a single boolean load with
//! `Ordering::Acquire` (which on x86 is just a compiler barrier, not an actual
//! memory barrier).
